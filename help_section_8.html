				<h1><a name="_Toc432261554"><span lang=EN-US>Classifications</span></a></h1>

<p class=UserGuide>The <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> has been conceived to help the DJ use their
music collection without having to remember it in detail. </p>

<p class=UserGuide>The classification process is slow and tedious but you only
do it once for each song and once done you can then explore your collection or
even let the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> explore it for you &#8211; it can put together tandas
around songs that are similar according to your own classification system
&#8211; it is surprisingly good at this and as a result hovering over “Auto
Generated Tanda” in the playlist brings up a “Save” button allowing the Tanda
to be saved. This is a great way to get lots of Tandas into your collection
with very little additional work!</p>

<p class=UserGuide>The classification process is controversial and definitely
not to everybody’s taste. But it serves another purpose. It makes you really
listen to your music.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>For an example, some DJs insist that the “Year” of the song
is important but ask yourself why?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>It is
not in itself an audible feature and certainly not all songs in one year will
sound the same so why use it?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>The Tanda
Player instead offers the ability to really think about the sound &#8211; so
for example is the main rhythm coming from the Bandoneons or the Violins or a
Bass etc. Are there single instruments or many? Are the notes played softly or
staccato?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Is the music played with lots
of energy or drama or is all much softer and mellow?</p>

<p class=UserGuide>TIP &#8211; try to avoid using classifications that can
overlap. For example if you have a list of styles, then a general <span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"MS Mincho";mso-ascii-font-family:bodyLightFont;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;
mso-hansi-font-family:bodyLightFont'>“</span>Vals<span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"MS Mincho";mso-ascii-font-family:bodyLightFont;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:bodyLightFont'>”</span>
may overlap with a more specific one &#8211; <span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
"MS Mincho";mso-ascii-font-family:bodyLightFont;mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";
mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:bodyLightFont'>“</span>Vals-Milonguero<span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"MS Mincho";mso-ascii-font-family:bodyLightFont;
mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho";mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;
mso-hansi-font-family:bodyLightFont'>”</span><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'>. So try to be consistent and use discriminatory classifications.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=UserGuide>Using the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> to record these more subtle and less
obvious musical features it might be possible to actually identify the same
songs by the same artist in the same year but without using the Year.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>One advantage of this is that you can now ask
the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> to find for example energetic music played staccato on violins
and find many songs that do indeed sound similar enough for dancers to enjoy
when played together in a tanda.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>The hard part is identifying what you hear in the music and
consistently capturing it. </p>

<p class=UserGuide>As a guide, imagine yourself trying to find songs or tandas
&#8211; is it the mood or a sound you want to find? Are you building energy at
the moment or are you trying to calm a busy dance floor down?<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Once you can imagine trying to query the system
you will start to get an idea of what you want to search on. Also remember to
include some properties for the purposes of filtering out too! For example, you
might want to record the sound quality so that you could at some point remove
poor quality tracks and then at another actively go and search for some. </p>

<p class=UserGuide>But do not go crazy and have hundreds of properties as this
will both make the classification stage of the process very tedious as you fill
in lots of details but also mean that fewer songs will share many of these
properties and as a result you will also restrict the ability of the Tanda
Player to help &#8211; especially if your collection is still not that big.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>It is strongly recommended therefore that you add just a few
songs to the USB stick and define some properties and try to classify
consistently with those. If you make mistakes or realize you need more
classifiers then you start again before you get too far into a big
collection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>But if you do get a long way
in remember you can always add a new property, which you can add to all new
songs, or you can go back and add it to older songs.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>If you remove a property the values are not
removed. So if you bring it back in the classification page the values
associated with that property in your songs will also re-appear.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>The classification page defaults to showing unclassified
songs but can be changed using the drop down list in the top left.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>In any listing you can add some text to
search for to find a particular song.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>The Quick Play controls top-right are mainly for adjusting
where in a song it plays from when you click it. Setting this to about halfway
across means that the song will start playing from about halfway through. This
can make identifying whether there is singing or not on a song quicker than
listening from the start.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>If you click on a song it will start playing &#8211; note
this is a dangerous application to use if playing Live! Clicking on a song will
also bring up the classification controls:</p>

<p class=UserGuide>If the song has been previously classified then this will
default the controls to the settings required. Otherwise they default to the
values set in the configuration page.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>Hiding inappropriate songs from the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> means that
they will not be offered in any searches and will not be used by any Auto-DJ
features. Hiding from the Auto-DJ will allow them to be found in searches but
not by the Auto-DJ.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>To set the beats per minute (BPM) simply tap on the hand
symbol and continue tapping along to the main danceable beat until the number
shown stabilizes around some value.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>Note that typically the main beat of Tango is around 60 BPM,
Waltzes are usually faster at around 70BPM and Milonga strangely has a strong
beat every four beats and so ends up being a quarter of what you might expect
at around 40 to 50 BPM. However you may hear the faster beat particularly on
some electronic Tango music and so marking these as 120BPM is a good thing
because then they will be different to the more traditional tango songs. </p>

<p class=UserGuide>Note that the headphone button works but will play from the
beginning of the song regardless of where the quick play settings are.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>However, note too that the sound-card used in
the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> has a powerful output and can drive many types of headphones
directly in which case there is no need to use the headphone buttons but simply
listen to the real output.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc432261556"><span lang=EN-US>ID3 Tags</span></a></h2>

<p class=UserGuide>Generally the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> does not use ID3 tag information
(which are the bits of additional information sometimes embedded in audio
files).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>It does use the artist and title
because they are pretty standard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Where
not available these are replaced by the filename/folder.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>However, when classifying from a collection where ID3 tags
have been used, a few of the more standard ones have been pulled in for reference
use only.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>They are presented on the main
classification screen (genre, grouping, date) and in the classifier pop-up
window via the second tab:</p>

<p class=UserGuide>Conversely <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> does not write any ID3 tags back to
the files but as the database file is available in JSON format on the USB

<p class=UserGuide>The date that files are added to the USB is captured too and
