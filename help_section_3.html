				<h1><a name="_Toc432261529"><span lang=EN-US>Music Database &#8211; Creating
the Library</span></a></h1>

<p class=UserGuide>Music is stored in two folders called “music” and “cortinas”
on a USB memory stick. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>If an empty memory stick is placed into the Tanda
Player as the only device and it is re-started, then the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> will copy
all the necessary files it needs for the database as well as creating these two
folders for you.<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p class=UserGuide>Once the USB has the necessary files and folders created you
can copy your own music to the corresponding folders.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>The Cortinas can be full tracks or pre-cut-down songs. The
folder can contain one level of additional folders and these can be called
things like Pop or Jazz etc. as a way to indicate what they contain. The Tanda
Player will use these folder names as sets of cortinas you can choose to
accompany any playlist.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Note that the
top folder MUST contain one song. This is so that if you choose cortinas for a
playlist there is at least one to use.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>The music folder can contain any number of folders and
sub-folders etc. These can be copied from your main music library directly.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>When the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> starts up it reads all music files and
stores their full path and filename inside its own database files. If you
subsequently add just one more file or even hundreds, it will spot these and
add them without losing any information added previously. If you remove any
files from the USB device these will be removed from the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span>’s own
database files next time it starts up.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc432261530"><span lang=EN-US>Adding Music</span></a></h2>

<p class=UserGuide>After you have got the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> up and running, sooner
or later you will want to add more music. Simply take the USB device to your
main music library and copy the new files as required. Then return to the Tanda
Player and re-start it. Upon startup the home page will show counters and these
will indicate the progress in two tasks:</p>

<p class=UserGuide style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l10 level1 lfo13'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='mso-fareast-font-family:bodyLightFont;mso-bidi-font-family:bodyLightFont'><span
style='mso-list:Ignore'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><![endif]>Getting the basic information</p>

<p class=UserGuide style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l10 level1 lfo13'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='mso-fareast-font-family:bodyLightFont;mso-bidi-font-family:bodyLightFont'><span
style='mso-list:Ignore'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><![endif]>Getting detailed information.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>The basic information is a quick scan which opens the file
and reads the MP3 file tags for the artist and title of the song. It also notes
the duration of the file as given by the operating system.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>The detailed information is a more detailed scan of the file
in which it is opened and verified to be a music file and is effectively played
from start to finish. Provided it can be read the system determines the actual
duration after removing any trailing silence there is in the song and also the
maximum gain that could be applied to the song that would avoid any
distortion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>This gain is then applied
whenever the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> plays the song so as to ensure that all songs play
with a consistent volume.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc432261531"><span lang=EN-US>Removing Music</span></a></h2>

<p class=UserGuide>Any files that do not pass the detail scan are flagged and are
viewable in the configuration / setup page under the “Music File Warnings &amp;
Errors” tab.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>In this tab you can also see the songs that have been marked
as to be hidden from the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> &#8211; because they are not suitable.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>You can click on the button to delete these from the USB
device to save some disk space either against each song one at a time or remove
all of them in one go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-no-proof:yes'><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape
 id="_x0000_i1202" type="#_x0000_t75" alt="Description: Macintosh HD:Users:david:Desktop:Screen Shot 2018-04-24 at 17.28.39.png"
 style='width:198pt;height:42pt;visibility:visible;mso-wrap-style:square'>
 <v:imagedata src="TPUG_files/image007.png" o:title="Screen Shot 2018-04-24 at 17.28.39.png"/>

v:shapes="_x0000_i1202"><![endif]></span></p>

<p class=UserGuide>Alternatively you can simply use a PC to delete the files
manually.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>When the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> next starts up it scans the USB device
and compares the list of files it finds with those it knew about previously and
any that have gone are removed from its own database. Note too that any Tandas
and/or Playlists that featured these songs are marked as invalid but are
otherwise left where they are so that you can replace the files or tandas to
restore the playlists etc.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc432261532"><span lang=EN-US>Duplicated Songs</span></a></h2>

<p class=UserGuide>It is possible to have your music collection scanned by the
<span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> as a way to attempt to spot multiple copies of the same song. </p>

<p class=UserGuide>See the whole section on this application later in this
document: <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span>’s Duplicate Song Viewer</p>
