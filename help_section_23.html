<p class=UserGuide>This application tries to find the same recording of a song
in different files.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Once found, the user
may remove unwanted versions of the song. If this song is in a Tanda already,
the user is prompted to find a replacement song from the other recordings to
keep the Tanda valid. Playlists are not updated!</p>

<p class=UserGuide>This application is offered as an optional use utility only.
It is not a requirement that it is used.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>Too many duplicate songs slow down the user whilst
classifying their collection because they will have to listen to and classify
the same recordings over and over again with no real benefit. This utility may
help in locating these duplicates early enough that you do not need to classify
the duplicated songs.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>The approach used is simple enough for the computer inside
the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> combined with the power of the web Browser on your PC or
laptop to perform. The simple approach is, as a consequence, error prone and
will identify possible matches that are not matches at all. However, the results
are quite good and may be useful in general even though it may report
significant numbers of false matches.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>The algorithm is often able to spot the same recording even
though they have been encoded in different file formats such as MP3 or FLAC and
can even show up matches on recordings where the re-mastering process in the
recording studio have changed the playback speed of the recording to make the
tempo match some ideal or where the sound has been modified to remove hiss or
similar artefacts in the original.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>The algorithm essentially “counts how many pixels differ
between the audio waveform files” that represent the song.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>It uses a few tricks such as
limited-time-warping to try to match up the waveforms as best as it can.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>However, clearly two waveforms may differ by
the same number of pixels but belong to very different songs.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Hopefully this is obvious to the user when it
occurs and it should be ignored.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>Recording techniques have changed a lot recently with the
use of computers in the recording studio. This application works reasonably
well on “old” Tango recordings where the waveforms are dynamic and shapely. It
does not work at all well on modern recordings where sound engineers have used
audio-processing techniques to get the maximum volume out of a song and which
results in quite solid looking waveforms.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>A usable waveform has lots of variation like this one:</p>

<p class=UserGuide>As a downside of the compromises used to develop the
algorithm so that it can run in the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> in a reasonable time frame,
the algorithm will make some invalid matches and some songs will look similar
to a very large number of other songs as far as the system is concerned.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>When a large number of songs appear to match
one song it is very unlikely this is true - however, it is often useful to look
down the list of these matches as within the list there may be pairs of songs
which are duplicates even if they are hidden among other invalid matches.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>In other words, when there are invalid
matches among plausible matches, just ignore the invalid ones. </p>

<p class=UserGuide>If you find the results useful, use them, if you do not,
then don’t use it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Other software tools
are available that attempt to do this sort of detection using sophisticated
algorithms but these require the power of desktop computers to work &#8211; the
<span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> is just not powerful enough.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>The processing requires the waveform files for all the songs
in the library. Under normal circumstances, the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> only generates
these as required. I.e. if the configuration does not require these (i.e. not
for headphone use or during live player use) these files will not exist yet. If
they have been produced already these files are usable by this process.</p>

required files used to store results</p>

<p class=UserGuide>Step 1 is therefore to generate all the required image
files. </p>

<p class=UserGuide>It is invoked by clicking this button:</p>

<p class=UserGuide><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-no-proof:

<p class=UserGuide>This step also creates a “fingerprint” or “signature” of the
waveform which can then be used for similarity testing. This process may take
quite a long time to run the first time. Subsequent runs (i.e. after you add a
few new songs to your library) may just take a few seconds to complete.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Therefore, for the first run it is recommended
to run this overnight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Because this
process runs both in the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> and in the Web Browser both need to be
left switched on for the entire time and in particular, the computer on which
the web browser is being used must be set up so that it will not go to sleep
after an hour or so to save power. Simply go into your computer settings for
power saving or similar and disable these temporarily.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>Once it has completed it is recommend that you save the
state of the application.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>However, even
without saving the state, subsequent runs of the same process will complete
much more quickly because the underlying waveform files will now exist on the
USB device and only missing signatures will be generated.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>Step 2 is simply to go through the results.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>The results are presented as a list of files:</p>

file.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>However, ripping the same song
from a CD and converting it to an MP3 or M4A file for example will produce
differences because, MP3 in particular, people often choose to compress their
music collection to take less disk space at the expense of losing some of the
data in the original file. The compression process attempts to remove sounds
that the human ear will not miss but these sounds may show up in the waveforms
and so different compression levels and different file formats will lead to
different waveforms.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Because of these
differences, the process requires a level of tolerance when comparing waveforms

<p class=UserGuide>The above shows a case where four songs appear to match. A
quick look at the waveforms shows that at least the first three are likely to
be the same, the last one is very similar but who knows! (Note that in the
above, the first file is 3 seconds shorter than the second! &#8211; possibly
the result of one file or the other being re-mastered (sped up or slowed down)
or it could be leading or trailing silence)</p>

<p class=UserGuide>The “Differences” is a count of differing pixels to the song
the group is based on. It must not be used as a way of determining how good a
recording it is &#8211; listen to the song! (For example, if the really bad
version of a song was the one the group was based on then it would have a
difference score of zero and all the good versions would have high scores indicating
that they are different from the bad version &#8211; The score is just an
indicator of similarity to the first song in the list and nothing else!)<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>If the count is zero it is extremely likely
that they are identical copies of the same song and only one of them needs to
be kept.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>For other differences, you may
decide to keep a few copies if for example the sound quality differs because
you may want either good or bad sounds to match up other songs when making a
tanda. However, each copy of a song will require you to go through and classify
it and so the more you leave, the more classifying you will need to do later!</p>

<p class=UserGuide>The “gain” value should be between 0 and -20 dB in order to
not lose output sound levels from the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span>. The player uses the
quietest song in your collection as the reference song and this controls the
maximum output possible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>See the
normalisation page in the setup app.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>If
you have a file whose gain is too low (below -20 dB) it will be shown either in
orange as a warning or red and these should be either deleted if better
versions are available or these should be removed and replaced with normalised
versions of these recordings &#8211; normalisation can be achieved using
commercial software. </p>

<p class=UserGuide>When listening alone does not allow the best version to be identified,
then the following rough guide may be used &#8211; but if you cannot tell by

<p class=UserGuide>The <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> is not a powerful computer and some music
file compression algorithms require a lot of computing power to unpack the data
in them in order to play them. The worst format identified to date is the “APE”
file format.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Although technically a good
format in that it is does not lose any data quality it is computer-intensive to
play and <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> can hesitate or skip during playback of these files.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>It is recommended therefore that for the
<span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span>’s version of these files you should make either a FLAC or better
still a M4A file with parameters set to keep a high quality if not lossless.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>Also, at the time of writing, the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> sends the
files to the user’s own web browser for playing through headphones and APE
files are not generally supported and so the DJ will not be able to listen to
these on headphones!</p>

<p class=UserGuide>Keep the files with the formats that lose the least
information. Typically MP3 files from a few years back are likely to have been
created to preserve disk space at the cost of losing data.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Also, MP3 files cannot be edited and re-saved
without losing more data and eventually ending up with a file that sounds
horrible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>So when other formats are
available, delete the MP3 version.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>By
contrast, FLAC files are lossless in terms of data and are easy to play and so
these are a good option. In the middle of the pack are M4A files which are
capable of being very high quality with no loss of sound quality (these can be
edited again and again with virtually no loss in sound quality). However, they
can still be used to compress heavily resulting in just as poor files as MP3
can and so listen to all available options and pick one.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>Author<span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"MS Mincho";

Opinion:</p>

<p class=UserGuide>Do not be tempted to convert files from one format to
another!</p>

<p class=UserGuide>MP3 files lose too much data in their creation to be able to
be re-converted. &nbsp;Do not attempt to re-convert a file that has been an
MP3. &nbsp;As a rule the compression algorithm for MP3 throws away about 90% of
the data leaving just 1 Mbyte of data for 1 minute of music.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>FLAC by comparison throws nothing away in the creation
process and so, like WAV files they are perfect copies of the original and if
need be, they can be reproduced into any other format - so these are good to
keep - unless you are short of disk space.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>M4A is similar to MP3 in that it is a compression algorithm
but unlike MP3, you can open them up and re-convert them in some way and
re-save as M4A without significant loss - tests have shown that you can
re-encode from M4A back to M4A about 100 times before you lose too much sound
quality. &nbsp;Also people generally use M4A more like a ZIP file for
documents, they have the settings which make it possible to get back nearly
everything perfectly.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>So DO NOT CONVERT anything. &nbsp;Keep MP3 if it is the best
version of a song!</p>

<p class=UserGuide>Otherwise, if you have FLAC and MP3, delete the MP3, if you
have FLAC and M4A keep the FLAC, if you have M4A and MP3 then keep the M4A etc.
&nbsp;BUT ONLY IF THE FILE BEING DELETED IS NOT AS GOOD A VERSION OF THE SONG!
&nbsp;It’s OK to delete a FLAC file and keep an MP3 if that is the better
version in your opinion.</p>

<p class=UserGuide><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=UserGuide>But as a special note: if you have APE files (which like
FLAC does not lose anything in the creation) and you have an M4A or MP3, then
remove the APE file. &nbsp;<span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> just is not powerful enough to keep up
with the processing required to decode these in real time whilst performing all
the other actions such as manipulating playlists or adjusting volumes etc.
&nbsp;Also, your laptops or computers will not play APE files through the web
browser, so you will not be able to listen to them on headphones - this would
require the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> to convert these on the fly to say M4A for you to
listen and that is yet more work &#8211; As a result, APE is not fully supported
even though technically it can play them. &nbsp;Perhaps the more powerful
future version using a Raspberry Pi 3B+ version will be able to cope better
with these but for now, avoid them if possible. &nbsp;As a contradiction to the
above: <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>If you only have APE versions,
then perhaps consider converting these into FLAC or M4A using some other
software.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=UserGuide>Note too that the differences score is not an indication of
quality of the song. &nbsp;Imagine you pick up a random thing - now describe
how different other things are to it. An identical thing would have zero
differences, and the more the differences increase, the less like the original
item it is - but remember, the original thing is still selected at random so it
might be a rubbish version of the song! &nbsp;So if you listen to the songs and
decide to keep the one with the most differences - that’s OK - you’ve said its
the best version - the difference score means nothing apart from a way to group
items that may be similar.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>To mark a song as not required, click the delete button on
the row. The row will turn red. It is not deleted at this point &#8211; just
