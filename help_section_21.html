<h2><a name="_Toc432261597"><span lang=EN-US>No sound and skips through a

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This has been traced to a loose connection
between the Raspberry Pi computer and the sound card - The issue is usually
reported as “no soundcard”.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>Obviously
there is one &#8211; it’s in the case! But it seems it can become loose.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The solution is simply to open the case, pull

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Remove the two screws as shown missing in
the picture. Then gently pull the lid from the base. This should separate the
two circuit boards as one is connected to the lid and one to the base. Once
done, just push back together again and re-assemble.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The cause is possibly a little rough
treatment causing the computer and sound card to move apart from each other a

<h2><a name="_Toc432261598"><span lang=EN-US>The software</span></a></h2>

<p class=UserGuide>The <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> is still a prototype and there may be
issues in use.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>If you can reproduce an
issue and if it prevents you from normal use then please contact David Goddard
for assistance, as it may be possible to fix the issue.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc432261599"><span lang=EN-US>No network</span></a></h2>

<p class=UserGuide>When the system starts up the Wifi-hotspot network should
become available within about 10 to 15 seconds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>Although you can connect to this network the actual <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span>
applications will not yet be available.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>If you do not get a network to connect to then it is likely
to be either the main micro-SD card with the operating system on has become
corrupt or the hardware has failed.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>Check power supplies and check the SD card is firmly in
place.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc432261600"><span lang=EN-US>No <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> application after
2 minutes</span></a></h2>

<p class=UserGuide>The software should start the web service up within a couple
of minutes depending upon how many songs you have added etc.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>If there is no sign of the application starting then the
most likely cause is the corruption of the USB memory stick that the music is
kept on. There are several reasons that this may occur:</p>

<p class=UserGuide style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l5 level1 lfo23'><![if !supportLists]><span

</span></span></span><![endif]>The device is coming to the end of its natural
life and beginning to fail</p>

</span></span></span><![endif]>The <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> was switched off or crashed
without using the button on the home page to stop the device.</p>

<p class=UserGuide style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l5 level1 lfo23'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol;mso-fareast-font-family:Symbol;mso-bidi-font-family:

</span></span></span><![endif]>No USB card?</p>

<p class=UserGuide>It is always recommended to have a backup of anything on the
USB devices as they can naturally fail.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc432261601"><span lang=EN-US>Recovering from a crash</span></a></h2>

<p class=UserGuide>If your USB memory stick has acquired some corrupt files and
as a result the system will not start, verify that the player itself is still
OK by putting a new USB device in the player and let it initialize it. If the
player then starts up the fault is most likely to be with one of the database
files.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>Each time the player starts up it copies all the database files
to a folder also on the USB device. There are ten copies of the database in
all.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>In the top level folder of the backups is a text file with a
number in it which is the number of the last back up written.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>Put the USB device in a laptop and attempt to fix the
device. Once done look at the backup folder and identify the last backup taken
when you know it last worked OK. Simply copy the entire contents of this backup
folder to the top level folder of the USB device replacing the corrupt database
files with good ones.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>Re-start the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc432261602"><span lang=EN-US>Bad files</span></a></h2>

<p class=UserGuide>Bad files are files found in the music folders that cannot
be played at all or play but with audible artifacts such clicks or skips in the
sound. Or a file may just suddenly stop.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>The <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span> is fairly tolerant of files typically found
in music libraries alongside the songs themselves. For example album artwork is
often stored in JPEG files in the same folders as the tracks. Similarly
operating systems add files such as “desktop.ini” to folders.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>Rather than have an exhaustive list of file types to avoid,
the system will instead try to play most things the first time you add it to
the system. Upon opening the files it will determine whether it is a playable
music file or not and even for those music files it will also check that it can
be played properly. It does this by scanning the entire file at around 20 times
normal playing speed in the background &#8211; about 5 to 10 seconds for most
songs. If a file has some encoding issues it marks the files as such. Similarly
if a file is simply not a music file it will be marked as such. </p>

<p class=UserGuide>Marked files may be hidden from the <span class="notranslate">Tanda Player</span>’s normal
operations in the same way the user can hide a song they do not wish to include
in their collection.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>In the configuration page there is a tab for “Music file
warnings &amp; errors” and this lists all songs that either the user or the
system has hidden from use.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>It also
lists those that appear OK but some errors were reported during the decoding.<span
style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>From here you can click a delete button to
remove the file from the USB drive, you can click OK and it will updated to no
longer be hidden the next time you start the system or you can click elsewhere
on the row for the track to play it in order to check whether it does appear to
play properly or not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span lang=EN-US>NOTE
&#8211; many songs are badly encoded but otherwise playable and errors such as
“Skipping … junk” is not normally an audible issue. <span
style="mso-spacerun:yes"> </span>However, “file growing?” occurs where the file
ended unexpectedly and the application simply wonders if it is being written at
the same time such as by a streaming application. These are usually useless as
music files and should be deleted. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=UserGuide>The decoding errors are typically caused by corruptions at
the time of encoding. They may or may not be audible as minor jitters in the
playback or entire songs suddenly ending. For this reason you can play the
marked songs by clicking on their filename and they will play and then click OK
if they play well enough or delete them if not.</p>

<p class=UserGuide>It is not recommended to keep lots of bad files as they take
up room in the database and slow down some operations unnecessarily.</p>
